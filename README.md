# SIRD_Epidemic_Simulation

SIRD Epidemic Simulation & Visualization 🦠📊
Overview
This project simulates the spread of infectious diseases using the SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model, offering interactive visualizations to analyze epidemic dynamics. The goal is to help understand how diseases spread and the impact of interventions like quarantine or vaccination.

Features
✅ Mathematical Modeling: Implements the SIRD differential equation model.
✅ Dynamic Visualization: Interactive plots to show real-time changes in population states.
✅ Parameter Customization: Adjust infection rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate to explore different outbreak scenarios.
✅ Data-Driven Insights: Helps in understanding disease transmission and potential intervention strategies.

Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Matplotlib 📊 (For data visualization)
Seaborn 🎨 (For enhanced graph styling)
NumPy & SciPy 🔢 (For mathematical modeling)
Jupyter Notebook 📒 (For interactive exploration)
