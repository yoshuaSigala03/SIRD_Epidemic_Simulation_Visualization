# ðŸ¦  SIRD Epidemic Simulation & Visualization  

This project simulates the spread of an infectious disease using the **SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model** and provides interactive **visualizations** to analyze epidemic trends.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  

âœ… **Mathematical Modeling** â€“ Implements the SIRD model to simulate disease progression.  
âœ… **Data Visualization** â€“ Generates intuitive graphs to show infection trends, recovery rates, and mortality impact.  
âœ… **Adjustable Parameters** â€“ Modify transmission rates, recovery rates, and death rates to observe different outbreak scenarios.  
âœ… **Built with Python** â€“ Uses `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Pandas` for visualization and data handling.  

## ðŸ“Š How It Works  

The **SIRD model** is a compartmental model that divides a population into four categories:  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Susceptible (S)** â€“ Individuals who can be infected.  
- ðŸ”´ **Infected (I)** â€“ Individuals who are currently infected and contagious.  
- ðŸ”µ **Recovered (R)** â€“ Individuals who have recovered and are no longer contagious.  
- âš« **Deceased (D)** â€“ Individuals who have died due to the infection.  

The simulation uses differential equations to model the rate of change between these compartments.
